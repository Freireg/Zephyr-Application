# Shell-example

One of Zephyr's OS tools is a Shell interface, very much like a Unix-like shell. Some of it's perks are:
* Support for multiple instances.
* Advanced cooperation with the Logging.
* Support for static and dynamic commands.
* Support for dictionary commands.
* Smart command completion with the Tab key.
* Built-in commands: clear, shell, colors, echo, history and resize.

This example shows the basics while using the shell and creating your custom commands.
