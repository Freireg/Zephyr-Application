# Zephyr-Application

## Overview
This is my personal Zephyr Workspace, in which I test and develop some basic interactions with Zephyr.

In this repository you may find some basic thread spawning examples, how to structure a project with an include folder, playing with overlay files, etc.

I'll be commenting on some of those examples in the future, so I can have some easy access examples.

## More usefull info
All the important stuff can be found in [Zephyr's Official Documentation](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/3.1.0/index.html).
